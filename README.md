# Face_Recognition_using_autoencoders
# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a facial recognition system using auto-encoders for a given dataset of class photos. The task involves implementing auto-encoders or denoising auto-encoders to extract features from the images and training a classifier neural network to recognize different faces in the dataset. The goal is to achieve maximum accuracy using the techniques taught in the course, without employing advanced techniques not covered in the curriculum.
